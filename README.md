=====================

* You need this [gm_stringtable](https://github.com/gmodcoders/gm_stringtable)
* This [gm_luamio](http://a.pomf.se/befabr.zip)
* And this [menu_plugins](https://github.com/gmodcoders/gmod-menu-plugins)

If you want to be able to override cs files you also need this: [gm_roc](https://github.com/gmodcoders/gm_roc)

## Warning
This might count as cheating on some servers (especially the part about replacing cs files) and might get you banned.
